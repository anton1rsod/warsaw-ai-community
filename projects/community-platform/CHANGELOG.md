## Versioning policy (placeholder — finalize during plan-writing)

| `0.1.0` | First implementation pass — identity + roles + minimal gamification |

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-01

### Added — Spec, plan, pre-launch, and handoff documentation
- Project scaffold: `README.md`, `spec.md` (stub), `plan.md` (stub), this changelog.
- Locked inputs in `spec.md` §0: four-role access model, gamification in scope, OSS-first, Telegram-complementary posture.
- Cross-links to sister projects (`persona-builder/`, `projects/gbrain/`) and program governance.
- **`spec.md` §1–§10 written** via `superpowers:brainstorming` (commit `97ccea2`, 2026-05-01).
  - Lite slice locked: identity + memory spine + one write surface (status updates).
  - Stack: Next.js 15 + Vercel + GitHub OAuth (JWT sessions) + GitHub App `warsaw-ai-bot`.
  - Storage: 100% git for v0.1; classification rule documented for v0.2+ DB return.
  - Long-term commitments captured in §10 (storage trajectory, federation horizon, OSS/commercial separation, gamification phasing, health metric).
- **`plan.md` written** via `superpowers:writing-plans` (commit `6f72f5c`, 2026-05-01).
  - 74 tasks across 11 phases (0–10). Each task: Files / failing test / run command / minimal implementation / passing-test verification / commit message.
  - Conventions section locks pnpm-only, ESM, strict TS, coverage gates (80% / 100% on auth-RBAC-classification-bot-week).
- **Minimal pre-launch landed** (commit `a736b38`, 2026-05-01).
  - Task 0.1: founder added to `community/members/roster.md` with handle `@anton1rsod`. Other 18 members remain `*(TBD)*` and cannot log in until updated.
  - Task 0.2: `community/governance/admins.md` created with founder; `community/governance/community-managers.md` created empty.
  - Task 0.3: deferred to Phase 7 prep (meeting attendees format will be retrofitted when contributions counter ships).
- **Handoff documentation** (commit `0fe4e78`, 2026-05-01): `HANDOFF.md` — cold-pickup reference compressing brainstorm + spec + plan journey for future readers (227 lines).
- **Execution plan** (commit `3194925`, 2026-05-01): `execution-plan.md` — subagent dispatch playbook with 7-chat session-division strategy, plan amendments, and per-phase risk register (396 lines).

### Pending
- Phase 0 implementation. Begin via `execution-plan.md` §11 (Kickoff procedure).
  - First subagent dispatch: Task 0.4 (Next.js 15 init).
  - Human-in-the-loop blocker: Task 0.12 (Vercel link + 13 env vars).
- Apply plan amendments at execution time:
  - §9.1 Task 1.1 — header-aware roster parser (skip `*(TBD)*` rows).
  - §9.2 Task 9.2 — `export const revalidate = 60;` on `/admin/health`.
  - §9.3 Task 4.2 — keep test PEM in repo with documented caveats.
- Roster `github_handle` backfill for the other 18 members (Phase 0 → Phase 1 prerequisite for non-founder logins).
